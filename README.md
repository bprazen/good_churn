# good_churn
A machine learning system to identifying "good churn" in data from a social discovery and dating app.

##Business Question: 

Dating apps have the unique problem of loosing the users that find their product most useful. Their churn is not completely bad.  Good churn results in word of mouth that will result in growth, but how do you identify good churn so that it can be used to improve the product, predict growth and entice investors, partners and users? My project addressed this problem.

Data:

The Social Discovery and Dating App that I am working with provided me with a dump of their PostgreSQL database (+25 table containing +200MB of data). Because this project is based on confidential data the data is not included in this repository.
